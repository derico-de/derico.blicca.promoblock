/**
 * An Aurora-shaped registry, and nothing more.
 *
 * Ticket 02 established that Blicca is upstream **plus deltas**, and that
 * the deltas are the risk this block carries: `choices` and
 * `backgroundColor`'s `styleFieldDefinition` are registered by the Blicca
 * wrapper and by nobody upstream, so a field that leans on either silently
 * degrades to a single-line text input in Aurora proper.
 *
 * ## This used to be a transcription. Ticket 15 replaced it with the real thing.
 *
 * Ticket 06 built this fixture by hand-copying `@plone/cmsui`'s
 * `config/widgets.ts` registration list and pointing each key at a named
 * placeholder component, leaving ticket 15 the choice of whether to install
 * the real Aurora installers instead. It decided: **install them**, and the
 * deciding argument was not fidelity in general but a specific circularity.
 *
 * The assertions this fixture exists to support are mostly assertions of
 * ABSENCE — `choices` is not registered upstream, nor `textarea`, nor
 * `select`, nor a `backgroundColor` style field. Against a transcription
 * those pass because *we chose not to transcribe them*. They restate the
 * fixture's own construction and cannot fail while the hypothesis they
 * describe is false. Against the packages Aurora actually ships, the same
 * line is an observation about upstream, which is what ticket 02 named as
 * the risk and what ticket 15 was asked to verify.
 *
 * A transcription is also a copy that must be resynced by hand: were
 * `@plone/cmsui` to rename or drop a widget, the copy would keep passing.
 * The real install fails, which is the point.
 *
 * Cost, stated honestly: the five installers pull the Aurora app stack into
 * this block's **devDependencies** (154 packages became ~670). They are
 * devDependencies only — the shipped bundle externalises `@plone/registry`
 * and `@plone/helpers` and carries none of the rest (see `vite.config.ts`),
 * and `test/aurora-harness.test.tsx` holds that line. They ship raw
 * TypeScript (`"main": "index.ts"`), so vitest transforms them directly with
 * no build step, and the whole install runs in well under a second.
 *
 * The versions are pinned to the ones the host provides — read off
 * `plone.blicca.auroraeditor`'s `wrapper/package.json`, not off npm's
 * `latest`, because the question this fixture answers is what THIS host's
 * Aurora does. `@plone/plate` is alpha.9 here while npm has newer.
 *
 * ## What is still local
 *
 * `UPSTREAM_WIDTHS` stays a transcribed literal deliberately: reading it back
 * out of the registry would make `workspace.test.tsx`'s width assertion
 * compare the registry to itself. As a literal it is a drift detector — if
 * `@plone/blocks` changes the four widths, that test fails.
 *
 * `BLICCA_ONLY_REGISTRATIONS` is likewise a hand-read list, transcribed from
 * the wrapper's `bootstrap/config.ts`, so a test can assert an override's
 * absence *by name* rather than with a bare `toBeUndefined()`.

 * inside each, guarded by `typeof group === 'object'`. But Blicca registers
 * the choices widget as `registerWidget({ key: 'choices', definition:
 * BliccaChoicesWidget })` — a bare component, not a `{ name: Component }`
 * map — and `registerWidget` stores a non-map definition AS the category:
 * `widgets.choices = BliccaChoicesWidget`. A function fails the
 * `typeof === 'object'` guard, so `getWidget('choices')` skips right over it
 * and returns `undefined` **whether or not it is registered**.
 *
 * `Field.tsx` knows this and reads `config.widgets?.choices` directly
 * (`getWidgetByChoices`). Every assertion about `choices` must use the same
 * path, or it is vacuous — which is what ticket 15's mutation run caught:
 * registering Blicca's widget into the fixture left every "no choices
 * widget" test in this suite green.
